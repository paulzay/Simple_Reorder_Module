## Project

The client desires a simple application that tracks inventory and makes automated reorders to their off-site warehouse when the stock level hits a predefined quantity. The warehouse attendant can see all reorders coming in and dispatch them to the store. Processed reorders are marked as such. Both the retailer and the warehouse can see pending and processed reorders.
